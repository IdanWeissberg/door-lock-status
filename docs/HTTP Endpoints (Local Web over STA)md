# HTTP Endpoints (Local Web over STA)

## GET /status
- Purpose: Phone UI polling endpoint for live door state.
- Response: 
  - 200 OK, `Content-Type: text/plain`
  - `Cache-Control: no-store`
  - Body: `Unlock` | `Locked` (exact strings, case-sensitive)
- Semantics:
  - `Unlock` → sensor LOW (microswitch closed, INPUT_PULLUP active-low)
  - `Locked` → sensor HIGH (microswitch open)
- Notes:
  - Serial logs print `CLOSED` / `OPEN` following the raw switch concept.
  - HTTP labels differ on purpose for UI wording. Keep as-is unless decided otherwise.

## GET /
- (Next step) Minimal page that shows the state and auto-refreshes every ~500 ms.
- Out of scope in this commit; tracked in the UI task.
